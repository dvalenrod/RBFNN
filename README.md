# RBFNN

This program uses a neural network to identify the species of iris in a dataset. 75% of the dataset is used for training, while 25% is used for validation. The program will display the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and accuracy of the neural network. Moreover, it generates a file called "out_rbfnn.txt" containing the expected and obtained data.

## Execution
